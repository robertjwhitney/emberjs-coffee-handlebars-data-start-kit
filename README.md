# Ember.js CoffeeScript/Handlebars/Ember-Data Start Kit

Ember.js already has a simple [start kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit) for JavaScript developers. Unfortunately starting with Ember.js and CoffeeScript is a little harder. It is possible to create a new Rails application with [ember-rails](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails) and let the asset pipeline handle the CoffeeScript. But when you start out with Ember.js you probably don't want an entire Rails application to start with. Maybe you won't want one at all.

Therefore the Ember.js CoffeeScript Start Kit exists. You get the great asset pipeline to handle CoffeeScript and SASS out of the box in a simple and small rack app. The directory structure mirrors the structure of a Rails application so a future switch to a full blown application is just a copy & paste away.

**This fork** also adds support for handlebars via the handlebars_assets gem. It also is an example of using ember-data.

## Getting Started
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies.
3. Start the server with `rake sever` or `rake s`.
4. Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Out of the box this app is set up to use ember-data and assumes you have a service running at localhost:9292. (see app.js.coffee).

The existing post resource assumes that your service on 9292 responds to '/posts' with json returning an array of posts like so:

```json
{ 
  posts: [
    {title: 'my first post'}, 
    {title: 'my second post'}
  ]
}
```
